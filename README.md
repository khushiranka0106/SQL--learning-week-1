# SQL--learning-week-1

This repository contains my first week of SQL practice using MySQL Workbench.
I worked with a real student dataset to understand how different queries affect actual records inside a relational database.

✅ What I Practiced

created a database and table structure

inserted multiple student records

updated marks using WHERE conditions

deleted specific rows safely

added a new column using ALTER TABLE

retrieved filtered and sorted results using ORDER BY, IN, and LIMIT

✅ Key Queries Covered

finding the highest-scoring student

calculating overall average marks

updating marks based on student ID

filtering data using WHERE, AND, and IN

sorting results in ascending and descending order

deleting rows based on conditions

✅ Dataset Overview

Table: students
Columns included:

student_id

name

age

class

section

email

marks

Total records: (update count after insertion)

This dataset was manually created to simulate a real-world student database.

✅ How to Run

Open MySQL Workbench

Import or open the SQL file:
chapter1_of_sql.sql

Execute queries step-by-step to view results

Modify data to experiment with different conditions


📌 Next Steps (Week 2)

GROUP BY

HAVING

JOINS

generating insights like:

total students per city

highest scorer per location
